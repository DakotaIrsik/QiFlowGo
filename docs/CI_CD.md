# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

QiFlowGo uses GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment. This document outlines the CI/CD workflows and how to use them.

## Workflows

### 1. Pull Request Validation (`.github/workflows/pr-check.yml`)

**Triggers:** Every pull request to `main`

**What it does:**
- Runs TypeScript type checking (`npm run lint`)
- Executes Jest unit tests with coverage reporting
- Ensures test coverage is above 75% (currently achieving **95.59%**)
- Builds the project to verify no compilation errors
- Uploads coverage reports to Codecov (optional)

**Matrix Testing:**
- Tests against Node.js 18.x and 20.x

**Preventing Merges:**
- PRs cannot be merged if any checks fail
- Coverage must be above 75% threshold

### 2. Backend Deployment (`.github/workflows/backend-deploy.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

**What it does:**
- Installs production dependencies
- Builds the TypeScript project
- Runs database migrations (when implemented)
- Deploys to cloud platform
- Performs health checks
- Creates deployment records

**Environments:**
- Production (default)
- Staging (manual dispatch option)

**Platform Support:**
The workflow is designed to support multiple deployment platforms:
- Firebase Functions
- AWS Lambda
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Custom servers via SSH

### 3. Mobile Build & Release (`.github/workflows/mobile-release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Version tags (v*.*.*)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**iOS Build:**
- Runs on macOS runners
- Installs CocoaPods dependencies
- Imports code signing certificates and provisioning profiles
- Builds and archives the iOS app
- Exports signed IPA file

**Android Build:**
- Runs on Ubuntu runners
- Sets up Java 17 and Gradle
- Decodes and uses release keystore
- Builds APK for testing
- Builds AAB for Play Store

**Release Process:**
- Downloads all build artifacts
- Generates release notes from git commits
- Creates GitHub Release with IPA, APK, and AAB files
- Tags release with semantic version

## Version Management

Use npm scripts to manage semantic versioning:

```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
npm run version:patch

# Minor release (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
npm run version:minor

# Major release (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
npm run version:major
```

**Automatic Checks:**
- `preversion`: Runs linting and tests before version bump
- `postversion`: Pushes commits and tags to remote

**Creating a Release:**
1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Run version script: `npm run version:patch`
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and release

## Required GitHub Secrets

### iOS Code Signing

- `IOS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` - Apple distribution certificate (base64 encoded)
- `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` - Provisioning profile (base64 encoded)
- `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` - Certificate password
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY` - For TestFlight uploads (optional)

**Encoding certificates:**
```bash
base64 -i certificate.p12 -o certificate.txt
base64 -i profile.mobileprovision -o profile.txt
```

### Android Code Signing

- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` - Release keystore (base64 encoded)
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` - Keystore password
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` - Key alias
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` - Key password

**Encoding keystore:**
```bash
base64 -i release.keystore -o keystore.txt
```

### Backend & Services

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL database connection string
- `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY` - SSH key for deployment to cloud servers (optional)
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` - Firebase admin credentials (optional)
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Codecov upload token (optional)

## Setting Up Secrets

1. Navigate to repository Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add each required secret with its value
4. Secrets are encrypted and only visible to GitHub Actions

## Rollback Strategy

### Backend Rollback

1. Navigate to Actions â†’ Backend Deployment
2. Find the successful deployment you want to rollback to
3. Click "Re-run jobs" to redeploy that version

### Mobile Rollback

- Previous releases are retained in GitHub Releases for 90 days
- Download previous IPA/APK from Releases page
- Redistribute to users or upload to app stores

## Health Checks

The backend deployment workflow includes health check verification:
- Waits 10 seconds for deployment to stabilize
- Calls `/health` endpoint
- Fails deployment if health check fails

**Implementing Health Check Endpoint:**
```typescript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### PR Check Failures

**Lint errors:**
```bash
npm run lint
```

**Test failures:**
```bash
npm test
```

**Coverage below 75%:**
- Write additional tests
- Check coverage report: `npm test -- --coverage`

### Deployment Failures

**Database migration errors:**
- Check `DATABASE_URL` secret is set correctly
- Verify migration scripts are valid

**Health check failures:**
- Check application logs
- Verify deployment environment variables
- Test health endpoint locally

### Build Failures

**iOS build errors:**
- Verify certificates and provisioning profiles are valid
- Check CocoaPods installation
- Review Xcode project settings

**Android build errors:**
- Verify keystore credentials
- Check Gradle configuration
- Ensure Java version compatibility

## Best Practices

1. **Always create PRs** - Never push directly to `main`
2. **Write tests** - Maintain >75% coverage
3. **Use semantic versioning** - Follow semver conventions
4. **Test locally first** - Run `npm run lint && npm test` before pushing
5. **Monitor deployments** - Check Actions tab for deployment status
6. **Keep secrets secure** - Never commit secrets to repository
7. **Document changes** - Write clear commit messages for release notes

## Release Artifacts

**Current Status**: Backend-only project
- Mobile app is not yet implemented
- Workflows are configured and ready for when mobile app is built

**When mobile app is implemented**, each release will generate:
- **iOS IPA**: `QiFlowControlCenter-v{version}-ios.ipa`
- **Android APK**: `QiFlowControlCenter-v{version}-android.apk`
- **Android AAB**: `QiFlowControlCenter-v{version}-android-bundle.aab`
- **Release notes**: Auto-generated from commit messages
- **Changelog**: Updated version history

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] TestFlight automatic upload for iOS
- [ ] Google Play Internal Testing upload for Android
- [ ] Automated E2E testing in CI
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Security scanning (Snyk, Dependabot)
- [ ] Database migration system
- [ ] Blue-green deployment strategy
- [ ] Canary releases
